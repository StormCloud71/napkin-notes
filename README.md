<H1>Napkin Notes and disconnected stuff.</H1>


This repository was made for testing and to add some disconnected stuff.

Hopefully, someday, somehting worthwhile might come out of this.

<ul>
<li>adamandeve.py : A mostly useless python program that was a basis for a DF-style community history generator. Contains a rudimentary person class (with stats and HP), a Markov queue name generator and some name corpuses. Might come handy. </li>
</ul>
