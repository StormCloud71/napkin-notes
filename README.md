<H1>Napkin Notes and disconnected stuff.</H1>


This repository was made for testing and to add some disconnected stuff.

Hopefully, someday, something worthwhile might come out of this.

<ul>
<li>adamandeve.py : A mostly useless python program that wanted to be a basis for a DF-style community history generator. Contains a rudimentary person class (with stats and HP), a Markov queue name generator and some name corpuses. Might come handy. </li>
<li>
didntknowthis.py : Another useless example. I honestly didn't know python could do this... I mean making a dictionary of functions and picking one at random. This too might come handy.
</li>
<li>
babbler.py : Another mostly useless example. A simple class with some saving and loading json functions. Might be useful to someone out there. JSON to load should be like {'name':<i>name</i>,'sayings_list':[<i>saying1, saying2, saying3 ...</i>]}
</li>
</ul>
